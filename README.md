# HackerRank Progress Report – Namava / Shatel Internship
---

I’m currently solving algorithmic and data‑structure challenges from [**HackerRank – 3 Months Preparation Kit**](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits/three-month-preparation-kit/).  

This repository is part of my **Software Engineering Internship** at **Namava / Shatel Group**.  
All solutions are developed in **C# (.NET, Console Applications)** and uploaded weekly according to the preparation‑kit schedule.  

Each update contains verified solutions with clean implementation, focused on readability, logic, and consistent coding style.  
All challenges are versioned and committed progressively according to the official preparation‑kit timeline.
